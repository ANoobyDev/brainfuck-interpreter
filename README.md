# WHAT IS BRAINFUCK?

Brainfuck is an esoteric language, or joke language, that is turing-complete and it works with cells. 
Even though it isn't very useful, it's an interesting experience every passionate programmer should 
experience. The name comes because coding on it does feel you that.

# HOW DO I BRAINFUCK?

This version of brainfuck has only 10 instructions, and those are:

```
 +  --> Adds 1 to the cell it's in.

 -  --> Removes 1 to the cell it's in.

 >  --> Changes the cell it's in by 1.

 <  --> Changes the cell it's in by -1.

 ,  --> Allows for ascii input.

 .  --> Echoes the ascii value of the cell.

 [  --> Starts a loop.

 ]  --> Goes to the last open bracket if it doesn't end on 0 / null.
```

Every character other than those is (hopefully) ignored.

# WHY?

Why i did it? Because I was bored. Why does this language exists in the first place? I guess someone felt the same way ~15 years before me.

# TODO
[x] Make it to interpret brainfuck(only in the python version atm).
[ ] Make it to COMPILE brainfuck.
[ ] Add more stuff to the TODO.

# AUTHOR NOTE

Hope you enjoy playing with this, it's possible to do some impressive stuff.
